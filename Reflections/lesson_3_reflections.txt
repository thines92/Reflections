When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want other people to be able to view and contribute to a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

If you are working on changes on your local system that are different from the remote
system and Git automatically pulled from GitHub, it could change the work you were doing.
